## About me

I’m Johannes Holmberg and I work with the web.
I’m a consultant frontend designer living and working out of beautiful <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=basel+switzerland&espv=2&biw=2290&bih=1316&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwi2u7--647QAhWHWxQKHRSgCVIQ_AUIBigB">Basel, Switzerland</a>.

I’ve been working on the web for the last 10 years, designing and developing usable online solutions. What I do is making design and technology work together on the web.

My services include interaction design, information architecture and front-end development. I work together with teams from companies all over the world to provide responsive and optimized user interfaces.

## About the site

This website was made in the purpose of creating a digital home to collect the writing and the work I do. The last couple of years I have downsized on my social media appearance and wanted to have a simple home where I can experiment at my own pace.

* The website is powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
* Currently hosted at [Netlify](netlify.com)
* Hand coded with HTML and CSS
* No frameworks were used in the creation of this site
* SASS helps with CSS maintenance
* Profile photo taken by [Erik Carlsson](http://erikcarlsson.se/)

I see this website as my playground so I don’t always worry how it looks across various browsers. But I’m keen about accessibility and usability issues so if you find something I might have missed, please let me know.
