# Uses

I got inspired by [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) to put together my own page with the tools that I use on an (almost) everyday basis. Things are changing pretty quick in our industry so expect this page to change up fairly often as well.

## Editor

* As so many others at the moment I‚Äôm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I came over from Atom, and before that I used Sublime Text for many years. I have also been a heavy proponent of Coda and back in the day I was on the Dreamweaver bandwagon üôÇ
* I‚Äôm using Wes Bos‚Äôs [Cobalt2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) theme which both looks great and has good contrast.
* Inconsolata is the font.

## Terminal

* I‚Äôve recently switched over to [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) from iTerm2.
* I use `hypercwd` to keep the directory structure for new terms and `hyperterm-visor` to set my global hotkey.
* To differentiate the terminal from my editor, I‚Äôm using the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme.

## Browser

* Google Chrome has been my browser of choice for many years but I‚Äôve recently switched over to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and I‚Äôm loving it. Their new rendering engine and dev tools are really top notch!

## Design

* I‚Äôm using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) for almost all things UI related.
* Prototyping I‚Äôm doing in [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/).
* For any type of image manipulation work I‚Äôm using [Pixelmator Pro](http://www.pixelmator.com/pro/). I‚Äôve used Photoshop for years, but I don‚Äôt say no to leaner and more efficient tools.
* [PixelSnap](https://getpixelsnap.com/) is a super useful tool for measuring any element on the screen. Have been using it a ton lately.
* And [ColorSnapper](https://colorsnapper.com/) is a must for easy picking of colors anywhere on the screen.

## Software

* I‚Äôm using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) to navigate my file system.
* Whenever I need a classic FTP client (which actually isn‚Äôt that often anymore) I use [Transmit](https://www.panic.com/transmit/) which is my favorite.
* [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) is great for those snippets you type over and over again.
* I am using [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/) for all my writing and [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) for my journaling.
* [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is my task manager and I‚Äôm following a [GTD mindset](https://gettingthingsdone.com/).
* I‚Äôve come to love [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) as my window manager.
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) keeps things nice and tidy in the menu bar.
* I‚Äôm using [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/) to annotate and share screenshots.
* [1Password](https://1password.com/) keeps all my password and important assets protected but easily accessible.

## Hardware

* At home I‚Äôm using a 27‚Äù iMac with Retina (Late 2014) and as a traveling companion I have a lightweight MacBook (Mid 2016) which is really awesome.
* For over 6 years I‚Äôve been using a black [Goruck Echo](https://www.goruck.com/echo/) to carry my laptop and for whenever I travel the world.
