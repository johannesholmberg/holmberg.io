Humtank is an initiative formed by a group of journalists from Swedish universities. The purpose of the blog is to have a collected writing platform for these editors where theyâ€™re aiming to take part in public debate and change the general conception of the humanities.

It was a project that took about 6 weeks for completion. It uses a hand-crafted theme for WordPress and the CMS is customized to make it easier for the editors in their daily work.
