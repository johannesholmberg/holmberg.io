I got the amazing opportunity to work on the frontend for Mio’s new e-commerce website. It was a complete overhaul with a responsive foundation. During the process I worked tightly with a team of skilled engineers and backend developers from [Valtech](http://www.valtech.com/) and [Enferno](http://www.enferno.se/).
